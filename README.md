## Goal of the project
</div>

+Every student at the Polytech University has faced the problem of finding the right audience or building at least once. And for first-year students who have just arrived at the university, this is always the main problem.

+Constant use of the university's website to search for the schedule of your study group is tiring: you need to do too many actions to get what you want

+Our product will help to overcome these difficulties. A multifunctional application for any device that combines all the key needs of the average student
