# PolyGo
***Schedule and Navigator for SPbPU***
## Project idea  
</div>

Create the first cross-platform application for comfortable movement around the campus and buildings of the Polytech University, also for convenient schedule tracking. 

The application should also provide navigation capabilities not only inside the main building, but also in others.

## Goal of the project
</div>

* Every student at the Polytech University has faced the problem of finding the right audience or building at least once. And for first-year students who have just arrived at the university, this is always the main problem.

* Constant use of the university's website to search for the schedule of your study group is tiring: you need to do too many actions to get what you want

* Our product will help to overcome these difficulties. A multifunctional application for any device that combines all the key needs of the average student

<div align="center">

## Proposed solution
</div>

* Multiplatform application. The interface will be comfortable to use on both iOS and Android

* The main feature of our application will be accurate maps of all campus buildings with geolocation support

* To make the application even more useful for the user, the schedule of the student's study group is also included in the interface

* An additional feature of the application will be everyone's favorite theme selection (light / dark)
